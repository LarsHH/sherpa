Welcome to SHERPA!
==================

SHERPA is a Python library for hyperparameter tuning of deep neural networks.

Its goal is to provide a platform for the implementation of innovations in
hyperparameter search algorithms. The tutorials section shows how to use some
of the implemented algorithms.
